# Oblig 1
First we went to finn.no to inspect the source-code on their website, and see what they have used how their layouts where and the structure of the website after looking through the finn.no pages, we search the code and highlighted the different elements using different colors and screenshots and later put them together in a png

## Our Structure
We tried to make our system reusable but still allow us to have spesific styles for each page. This took a while but we ended up making spesific modifiers while trying to retain styles for each element. With some more time and more organizing in the beginning we would have ended up reducing the code more. 

## Work/Approach
We then made our own branches in GitHub so we could start working on setting up and creating each screenshot. started building on our own HTML documents to sett up a "skeleton" website slowly learning more and more how to use BEM in combination with SCSS. looking after and implementing logos, pictures and images from [https://www.fabric-ds.io/icons](https://www.fabric-ds.io/icons) continued to look as closely as we could on our finn.no pages, finding the different element styles, colors etc
and implementing the styles into our own code. [https://www.finn.no/](https://www.finn.no/). 

In the beginning we didn't merge with the main, and just stood and worked inside our own branches but when it came to assembling our code and solving merge conflicts de we realize all the extra work we could have spared ourselves by pushing more often and working together with elements. 

But when we got the hang of doing it more often, we took up the pace with merging and using up more of our code and implementing elements while at the same time not interfering with each others screenshot websites.
