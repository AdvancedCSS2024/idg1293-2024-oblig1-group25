went to finn.no to inspect the source-code on their website, and see what they have used
how their layouts where and the structure of the website
after looking through the finn.no pages, we search the code and highlighted the different elements using different colors
(see "untitled-1.png in /misc)
made our own branches in GitHub so we could start working on each screenshot
started building on our own HTML documents to sett up a "skeleton" website
slowly learning more and more how to use BEM in combination with SCSS.
looking after and implementing logos, pictures and images from finns fabric-ds.io page
continued to look as closely as we could on our finn.no pages, finding the different element styles, colors etc
and implementing the styles into our own code.
took longer time to start pushing progressive code into the main branch and start using each other code.
